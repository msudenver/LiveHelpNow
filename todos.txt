Chat text font: needs to be Open Sans but font is controlled by an iframe.

Scroll bars on chat and pre-chat layouts can be eliminated using overflow:hidden. However, window remains re-sizable such that content can become hidden. Ideal solution would be to lock window size (to a min-width/min-height) but this cannot (?) be accomplished without javascript.
